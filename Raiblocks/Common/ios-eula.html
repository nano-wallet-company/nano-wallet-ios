    This Agreement governs your use on your iOS mobile device of the compiled,
    executable <strong>Nano Wallet </strong>iOS mobile application released by
us, and all related documentation (collectively, the "    <strong>Application</strong>").
</p>
<p>
    The Application is licensed (not sold) to you, pursuant to and subject to
    your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
</p>

WHERE PROMPTED IN THE APPLICATION AND THEN TAPPING THE "<strong>AGREE</strong>" BUTTON, YOU: (A) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND
    UNDERSTAND THIS AGREEMENT; (B) REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT OR OVER THE AGE OF
    MAJORITY IN THE JURISDICTION(S) IN WHICH YOU RESIDE AND IN WHICH YOU ARE
    USING THIS APPLICATION AND OTHERWISE HAVE THE COMPENTENCY AND CAPACITY TO

    AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE LEGALLY BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
    IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY TERM OR CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN YOU DO

<p>
    THE APPLICATION IS OWNED, OPERATED AND RELEASED BY NANO WALLET COMPANY
    ONLY. NANO WALLET COMPANY IS INDEPENDENT OF, AND OPERATES SEPARATELY FROM,
    THE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING, OPERATING, MAINTAINING OR SUPPORTING
    THE NANO PROTOCOL, THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK, THE NANO CURRENCY OR ANY
    SOFTWARE WALLET THAT IS NOT RELEASED BY NANO WALLET COMPANY (COLLECTIVELY,
    "<strong>SEPARATE TECHNOLOGIES</strong>"). FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, NANO

    APPLICATION AND YOUR CREATION AND ACCESSING OF A WALLET ON THE NANO BLOCK
    LATTICE NETWORK (A "<strong>WALLET</strong>") USING THE APPLICATION DOES
    NOT INVOLVE THE OPENING, ESTABLISHING OR MANAGING OF AN "ACCOUNT" WITH NANO

    THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK.
</p>
<p>
    A "<strong>WALLET SEED</strong>" IS A UNIQUE CODE THAT IS PROVIDED TO YOU
    BY THE APPLICATION, THROUGH ITS DIRECT INTERACTION WITH THE NANO BLOCK
    LATTICE NETWORK (I.E., WITHOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT) WHEN YOU FIRST CREATE A NEW
    WALLET USING THE APPLICATION. YOUR WALLET SEED IS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO
    RECOVER YOUR WALLET ON THE NANO BLOCK LATTICE NETWORK AND ACCESS ANY NANO
    CURRENCY YOU STORE IN THAT WALLET.
</p>
<p>
    WE DO NOT RECEIVE, COLLECT, RECORD, STORE OR HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR WALLET
    SEED. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT RECOVER IT FOR YOU IF YOU LOSE IT AND WE CANNOT
    PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCESS TO ANY NANO CURRENCY THAT YOU STORE IN YOUR WALLET.
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RECORDING YOUR WALLET SEED IN A SAFE AND
    SECURE PLACE AND MANNER. DO NOT SHARE YOUR WALLET SEED WITH ANYONE, OR
    PERMIT ANYONE TO USE YOUR MOBILE DEVICE ON WHICH THE APPLICATION IS
    INSTALLED WHO YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS YOUR WALLET OR YOUR NANO
    CURRENCY.
</p>
<p>
    ANY NANO CURRENCY THAT YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS, HOLD, STORE, MANAGE, RECEIVE,
    SEND OR TRANSMIT USING THE APPLICATION, AND ANY BALANCE AND TRANSACTION
    INFORMATION RELATING TO IT, ARE NEVER ACCESSED, HELD, STORED, MANAGED,
    RECEIVED, SENT OR TRANSMITTED BY NANO WALLET COMPANY.
</p>

<p>
    YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SECURITY OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, YOUR
    NANO CURRENCY, AND YOUR WALLET SEED. NANO WALLET COMPANY IS NOT AND WILL
    NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE SECURITY OR PROTECTION OF YOUR
    NANO CURRENCY OR WALLET SEED.
